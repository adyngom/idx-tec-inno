# Build Modern Web Applications with Angular & AI

Web application development has grown in complexity over the year due in parts to the awesome expectations it has set for itself in matter of performance, responsiveness, intuitiveness or in short magic.

It takes a lot to actually develop a production ready project, but framework like Angular have come a long way in providing great conventions on how to build for the web and mobile and build it right.

As if it was not enough already, Artificial Intelligence AI has invited itself to the party and is here to stay. 

Google just released project IDX, a cloud based development that comes with a built in AI code helper. 

We will look at developing a Movies and TV web app to learn about the basic building blocks with Angular and if we get stuck or confused along the way, we will see how IDX AI can be very handy as your second coding brain by providing you with helpful suggestions and helping you debug cryptic errors as they come along.
